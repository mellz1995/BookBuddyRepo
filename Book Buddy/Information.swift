/*
 The purpose of this class is for a user to store books in their 'library'. It uses a multi-d array
 
 Example: userLibrary[1][0] would be the title of the second book
 The first index will be like 'book information' that contains the title, author, isbn10-13, publisher and language.
 The second index are as follows:
 0 Title
 1 Author
 2 isbn10
 3 isbn13
 4 publisher
 5 lanugage
 6 status (owner, borrowed, lent)
 7 ImageFile
 8 Boolean whether the user has manually set an image for the book
 9 Owner of the book
 10 Book Id
 11 Date of the book requested to be borrowed
 12 The user that's requesting to borrow the book
 13 The book is claimed returned
 */


/*
 INFORMATION ON THE SEARCH FOR USERS ARRAY
 0 username
 1 profile picture
 2 userID
 3 didAddFirstBook
 4 isLibraryPrivate
 */


/* 
  INFORMATION ON THE LINKS ARRAY'S INDEXES
 0 User ID
 1 Username
 2 User's photo
 */


/**
    HOW TO GET, APPEND, AND SET A 2D ARRAY TO THE PARSE SERVER
 1. Get the current userLibrary from the server
    set the userLibrary variable = to the the library variable on the server. Don't forget to add 'as! [[String]] at the end of it
 2. append userLibrary with an array that has 5 indexes as denoted above
 3. use the function in user gus to add the book to the parse server online
 
 If this isn't enough information, refer to the code in Notes at the bottom of 'Links for Senior Project' and also at the bottom of this page
